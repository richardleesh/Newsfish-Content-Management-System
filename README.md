"This project is for the Downsview Advocate newspaper. It is a content management system. Right now, the workflow is like this: the writers submit articles to the editor in various forms. The editor arranges all the articles to the realtimeboard  web app and blocks off. The sales manager puts all the ads on and blocks off too. The editor and sales manager upload the articles and ads to google drive. The designer checks the space arrangement from realtimeboard and grabs the contents from the google drive and designs. There are a lot of human labours and cost a lot of time. "
